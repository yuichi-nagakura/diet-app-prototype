## Working with Documentation

When creating new application design documents:
1. Place them in the `docs/` directory
2. Use descriptive Japanese or English filenames
3. Include the year in the filename for version tracking
4. Follow the existing format established in ダイエットアプリ設計書_2025.md

## Documentation Standards

The existing diet app design document demonstrates the expected structure:
- Executive summary with market data
- Detailed case studies (domestic and international)
- Market trends and success factor analysis
- Strong hypotheses backed by data
- Comprehensive app design recommendations
- Technical stack recommendations
- Business model details
- Implementation roadmap
- Risk analysis

When creating similar documents, ensure inclusion of:
- Latest market research (use WebSearch and WebFetch tools)
- Concrete data points and statistics
- Both domestic (Japanese) and international examples
- Clear, actionable recommendations
